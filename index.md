# What is <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Requiem</span>?

**<span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Requiem</span>** is a novel *blackbox* approach for launching stealthy attacks on UAVs.
The objective is to cause *deviation* while keeping the vehicle's operation *seemingly* normal.
An example effect of the attack is shown in the video below where the vehicle thinks it is making the green trajectory while in reality, it is creating the red trajectory.
